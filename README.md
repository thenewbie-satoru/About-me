# About-me
# 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub!

Hi there! 👋  
I'm currently learning **cybersecurity** and using this space to keep track of my journey.

📚 Here, you'll mainly find:
- Certificates I've earned 🏆
- Study notes and learning resources ✍️

> This GitHub is a personal archive — I'm not actively seeking collaborations or connections.

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
